# AOT v2 M0 and M1 test slice

This directory contains the first implementation slice of the AOT v2 design.

- `include/lat-aot-v2.h` is the stable ELF note, module descriptor, TB, and PC
  map ABI. LBT and LSX are mandatory; LASX is an optional artifact variant.
- `runtime/elf-validate.c` parses and checks an artifact through an already
  opened fd before `dlopen()`.
- `runtime/module-loader.c` loads the validated fd, resolves the versioned
  descriptor, and verifies all descriptor ranges against mapped ELF segments.
- `runtime/registry.c` publishes immutable guest-range snapshots and supports
  multiple guest load biases for one shared Host artifact. It also fills the
  guest-address slots immediately before the existing `$fp` jump-cache base.
- `compiler/module-pack.c` converts supported TBs from the current
  `.latnative` intermediate into position-independent module text and metadata.
  Runtime helper calls use a local trampoline and guest addresses use negative
  `$fp` offsets; neither operation requires runtime `.text` changes.
- `compiler/module-inspect.c` validates an AOT ELF without executing it and
  reports its identity, feature requirements, TB count, and PC-map count.
- `scripts/link-aot-v2-module.sh` links the generated objects into a
  deterministic LoongArch `ET_DYN` file.
- `tests/fixture.c` and `tests/fixture-entry.S` build a real LoongArch
  `ET_DYN` fixture whose synthetic TB returns `42` through the versioned runtime
  dependency.

The M1 tests execute real LAT-generated TBs for `x86-exit42`, the no-libc
static hello, and a static glibc hello. The module-level test captures x86
syscall state after translated code saves it. The dynamic runner routes the
same syscall exit to LAT's existing `helper_raise_syscall`; the normal
linux-user CPU loop then executes `linux-user/syscall.c`.

The packager publishes every supported TB from the native image. Direct edges
remain inside the module. On the first indirect lookup the runner creates a
thread-local compatibility `TranslationBlock`, then fills both LAT's fast jump
cache and QEMU's TB cache. Repeated indirect jumps go directly to read-only
module text. Missing TBs still reach the normal lookup path and are rejected by
the strict M1 tests.

The AOT ELF does not contain LAT `TranslationBlock` objects, and module loading
does not register all TBs in QEMU's qht or TCG Host-PC tree. The current
`cpu_tb_exec()` interface still accepts `TranslationBlock *`, so the adapter
creates compatibility objects only for selected TBs. A later execution API
should accept `LatAotTargetV2` directly and remove them.

The copied LAT code generator saves vector state with LASX instructions, so
these modules declare `LAT_AOT_FEATURE_LASX`. A separate LSX-only lowering is
still required for CPUs without LASX; LBT and LSX remain mandatory for every
variant.

Native intermediate v2 contains stable instruction-level Host ranges and guest
PCs decoded from LAT's existing search data. The packager copies the complete
map for every published TB into `.rodata.lat.map`; the loader checks that these
ranges are ordered, non-overlapping, inside read-only module text, and use the
supported dynamic-state record. Such modules declare
`LAT_AOT_MODULE_PRECISE_PC_MAP` and no longer carry
`LAT_AOT_MODULE_M1_TEST_ONLY`.

LAT's signal recovery now searches the module PC map and calls the existing
`restore_state_to_opc()` path. The loader validates PC-map coverage in host
offset order without the former TB-count times map-count scan. AOT v2 also
disables the guest vDSO for M1, so libc uses syscall instructions already
present in the static main ELF instead of requiring JIT for runner-provided
vDSO code.

On `3a6000-25g`, all official SPECint2000 train workloads passed on 2026-08-25
with a 60-second limit and zero runtime translation attempts and calls:

| 164.gzip | 10.040804 |
| 175.vpr | 6.155109 |

M1 remains a static `ET_EXEC` milestone. Dynamic `PT_INTERP` startup, shared
object discovery and registration, executable mapping invalidation, unloading,
direct `LatAotTargetV2` execution, and an LSX-only artifact remain M2 or later
work. Ref inputs have not been run.

On LoongArch, after producing a `.latnative` image with the existing exporter:

```sh
make -C tools/latc test-aot-v2-translated \
  NATIVE_IMAGE=/path/to/program.latnative
```

The normal M1 command accepts the x86 ELF directly:

```sh
build/latc compile-module /path/to/x86-program -o program.so \
  --runner /path/to/static-exporter/latx-x86_64 \
  --runtime-dir /path/to/aot-v2-runtime
build/latc inspect-module --json program.so
```

`LATC_AOT_RUNNER` and `LATC_AOT_RUNTIME_DIR` may replace the two command-line
options.

Build and test the disposable dynamic LAT runner with:

```sh
tools/latc/scripts/build-aot-v2-runner.sh \
  /path/to/full/lat /path/to/aot-v2-runner
make -C tools/latc test-aot-v2-runner \
  AOT_V2_RUNNER=/path/to/aot-v2-runner/latx-x86_64 \
  AOT_V2_RUNTIME_DIR=/path/to/aot-v2-runner \
  X86_GUEST=build/tests/x86-static-hello \
  NATIVE_IMAGE=/path/to/x86-static-hello.latnative
```

The static glibc and SPEC M1 tests are:

```sh
make -C tools/latc test-aot-v2-glibc-runner \
  AOT_V2_RUNNER=/path/to/aot-v2-runner/latx-x86_64 \
  AOT_V2_RUNTIME_DIR=/path/to/aot-v2-runner \
  X86_GUEST=/path/to/static-glibc-hello \
  NATIVE_IMAGE=/path/to/static-glibc-hello.latnative
make -C tools/latc test-specint-aot-v2 \
  RUNNER=/path/to/static-exporter/latx-x86_64 \
  AOT_V2_RUNNER=/path/to/aot-v2-runner/latx-x86_64 \
  AOT_V2_RUNTIME_DIR=/path/to/aot-v2-runner \
  SPEC_ROOT=/path/to/spec2000
```
