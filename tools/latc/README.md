# latc

`latc` is an internal x86-64 to LoongArch64 binary compiler experiment. It is
built independently and does not modify or link against objects from the
parent LAT build. `latc compile` builds a startup-pretranslation bundle;
`compile-aot.sh` runs LAT's relocatable code generator on a LoongArch build host
and embeds the resulting native code and relocation records.

## AOT v2 module prototype

AOT v2 is the new per-x86-ELF module design. It keeps the original x86 program
as the user-visible launch target and loads cached LoongArch `ET_DYN` modules
inside LAT. The design and confirmed runtime rules are in
[`AOT_V2_DESIGN.md`](AOT_V2_DESIGN.md).

Milestone M0 defines the standalone ABI, validates an artifact before
`dlopen()`, and provides a minimal multi-instance registry. On a LoongArch
host, build and execute the real shared-object fixture with:

```sh
make -C tools/latc test-aot-v2
```

On other hosts the same target runs the architecture-independent ELF format
and registry tests. M1 packages all supported TBs from real LAT output and
executes no-libc hello, static glibc hello, and SPECint2000 train through the
AOT registry and existing linux-user syscall path.

On a LoongArch build host, compile and inspect an AOT v2 module with:

```sh
build/latc compile-module /path/to/x86-program -o program.so \
  --runner /path/to/static-exporter/latx-x86_64 \
  --runtime-dir /path/to/aot-v2-runtime
build/latc inspect-module --json program.so
```

M4 adds a separate per-user compiler process. The first implemented step
accepts one read-only x86 ELF file descriptor over a Unix socket, compiles a
stable snapshot, validates the module source digest, and publishes it with an
atomic rename:

```sh
build/latcd/latcd --once --socket "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/latcd.sock" \
  --cache-dir /path/to/cache --latc build/latc \
  --runner /path/to/latx-x86_64 --runtime-dir /path/to/aot-v2-runtime
build/latcd/latcd --submit --socket "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/latcd.sock" \
  /path/to/x86-program
```

On a LoongArch host, `make test-latcd-once` validates compiler failure cleanup,
bad sources, writable descriptors, malformed compiler output, replacement of a
bad cache entry, strict AOT execution, and an existing-module cache hit. The
The resident service uses the same trusted configuration and adds one compiler
worker, SHA-256 deduplication, a priority queue, resource limits, bounded
failure delays, and atomic status counters:

```sh
build/latcd/latcd --serve --socket "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/latcd.sock" \
  --cache-dir "$HOME/.cache/latx/aot-v2" --latc build/latc \
  --runner /path/to/latx-x86_64 --runtime-dir /path/to/aot-v2-runtime \
  --x86-rootfs /path/to/x86-rootfs \
  --stats "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/latcd-stats.json"
```

The socket parent must be owned by the current user and have no group or other
permissions. Set the same socket on the runner to request missing modules:

```sh
LATX_AOT_V2_CACHE_DIR="$HOME/.cache/latx/aot-v2" \
LATX_AOT_V2_LATCD_SOCKET="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/latcd.sock" \
  /path/to/latx-x86_64 -L /path/to/x86-rootfs /path/to/x86-program
```

The runner sends the already-open ELF FD with a nonblocking `sendmsg` and does
not wait for an acknowledgement or compilation. `compiler_submissions` means
the packet reached the Unix socket; daemon counters and cache files report the
final result.

The module contains instruction-level Host-PC to guest-PC records in
`.rodata.lat.map`. The runner publishes every supported native-image TB,
restores x86 state from those records on a Host signal, and puts direct Host
addresses in LAT's fast indirect jump cache after the first lookup. It does not
create compatibility `TranslationBlock` objects. M2 also discovers dynamic
main, loader, and libc mappings by source SHA-256 and actual load bias.

Run all twelve official SPECint2000 train workloads on LoongArch with:

```sh
make -C tools/latc test-specint-aot-v2 \
  RUNNER=/path/to/static-exporter/latx-x86_64 \
  AOT_V2_RUNNER=/path/to/aot-v2-runner/latx-x86_64 \
  AOT_V2_RUNTIME_DIR=/path/to/aot-v2-runner \
  SPEC_ROOT=/path/to/spec2000
```

The test rejects partial modules, any runtime TB generation, invalid SPEC
output, and a benchmark that exceeds 60 seconds. M1 passed all twelve train
workloads on `3a6000-25g` on 2026-08-25. Ref inputs were not run.

After building an AOT v2 runner, rerun the complete M4 test set with:

```sh
make -C tools/latc test-aot-v2-m4 \
  RUNNER=/path/to/exporter/latx-x86_64 \
  AOT_V2_RUNNER=/path/to/aot-v2/latx-x86_64 \
  AOT_V2_RUNTIME_DIR=/path/to/aot-v2 \
  X86_ROOTFS=/path/to/x86-rootfs SPEC_ROOT=/path/to/spec2000
```

This includes cold/warm compiler service tests, static glibc, signal recovery,
dynamic loading and symbol semantics, and a fresh SPECint train 12/12 build and
run. It does not run SPEC ref.

`latc inspect` reports this existing format as
`execution_model=lat-aot-bundle`. It is deliberately not called a standalone
native ELF: the file still contains the LAT runner and can enter LAT's JIT.

The standalone native ELF work retains the versioned fallback interface in
`native/include/lat-fallback.h`, but direct static execution currently requires
every referenced guest TB to be present. Export, image validation, relocation,
and runtime dispatch reject a missing TB instead of silently entering LAT's
JIT or another translated address.

Generate the current stable native image on a LoongArch build host with:

```sh
tools/latc/scripts/compile-native-image.sh build/latc \
  /path/to/latx-x86_64 /path/to/x86-program program.latnative program.tbset
build/latc inspect-native --json program.latnative
```

This `.latnative` image is an intermediate file. Use `compile-native-elf.sh`
to link it with the small runtime and produce the executable LoongArch ELF.

Build the current LoongArch PIE shell with:

```sh
tools/latc/scripts/link-native-shell.sh program.latnative program.la64
program.la64 --latc-inspect
```

The normal one-step command accepts a static x86-64 ELF and writes the final
LoongArch executable directly:

```sh
tools/latc/scripts/compile-native-elf.sh build/latc \
  /path/to/latx-x86_64 /path/to/static-x86-program program.la64
./program.la64 arg1 arg2
```

The command generates the native image in a temporary directory, verifies and
marks the embedded static x86 ELF, then links the runtime shell. An optional
fifth argument supplies a profile file.

Set `LATC_LA64_LDFLAGS=-static-pie` when the LoongArch toolchain provides
static libc objects and the output must have no ELF interpreter or shared
library dependency.

The shell embeds the image in read-only `.latc.image` and validates it on the
target host. Images marked for static x86 execution run the guest directly and
pass normal command-line arguments and environment variables through the x86
Linux initial stack.

`--latc-map` validates and maps the embedded static x86 ELF `PT_LOAD` segments
at their recorded addresses, applies final page permissions, prints the mapped
range, then unmaps it. This is a loader test only; it does not enter guest code.

`--latc-relocate` copies the LoongArch code into an anonymous mapping near the
PIE, applies every stable guest-address and runtime-symbol relocation, flushes
the instruction cache, changes the mapping from RW to RX, then unmaps it.

The first execution test is intentionally independent of x86 and LAT context
switching. `tests/make-native-smoke.c` creates one TB containing two hand-coded
LoongArch instructions which return `42` under the normal C ABI. The PIE runs
it only when the image carries `LAT_NATIVE_IMAGE_C_ABI_SMOKE`; normal exported
LAT images cannot use this path.

`tests/make-native-state-smoke.c` is the next layer. Its TB receives a
`LatX86StateV1 *`, changes `gpr[0]` from 35 to 42, writes `rip=0x1234`, and
returns 42. This verifies the shared state layout and calling convention before
adding LAT's context-switch assembly.

`tests/make-native-dispatch-smoke.c` contains two TBs. The first changes
`gpr[0]` from 5 to 12 and sets `rip` to the second TB; the second doubles it to
24 and clears `rip`. The runtime performs two `(rip, flags)` lookups and stops
when `rip` becomes zero.

`tests/x86-exit42.S` is the first real x86 input. It performs only
`exit(42)`. `compile-native-image.sh` verifies that the embedded guest is an
x86-64 ELF without `PT_INTERP`, marks it for static execution, and records the
LAT build ID required by the runtime. Guest SHA-256 values are recorded for
identity and diagnostics, not used as an execution allowlist.
`tests/x86-exit-add42.S` uses real x86 arithmetic to compute 42 before the
same restricted exit syscall.
`tests/x86-exit-loop42.S` executes a six-iteration x86 loop across four CFG
TBs, adding seven each time before exiting with 42.
`tests/x86-exit-memory42.S` loads 35 from the static guest data segment through
RIP-relative addressing, adds seven, and exits with the result.
`tests/x86-exit-call42.S` uses the guest stack for a direct call and return. The
restricted entry path initialises x86 RSP before entering translated code.
`tests/x86-write-exit42.S` writes `OK` through the restricted syscall helper,
returns to translated code, and then exits with 42.
`tests/x86-stack-exit42.S` reads `argc` and `argv[0]` from the Linux-compatible
initial guest stack before exiting with 42.
`tests/x86-brk-exit42.S` and `tests/x86-mmap-exit42.S` allocate writable guest
memory through returning syscalls, store 35, add seven, and exit with 42.
`tests/x86-file-exit42.S` opens `/dev/zero`, reads and checks one byte, closes
the descriptor, and exits with 42.
`tests/x86-open-error42.S` checks that a missing file returns x86 Linux
`-ENOENT`, not the host libc's raw `-1`.
`tests/x86-c-exit42.c` is compiled C code with a loop, local state, and normal
function calls. A minimal assembly `_start` exits with the C return value.
`tests/x86-indirect-call42.S` loads a function pointer from the guest data
segment and calls it indirectly before exiting with 42.
`tests/x86-runtime-indirect-call42.S` derives two function pointers from
`argc`, performs two nested runtime indirect calls, and checks both x86 return
addresses and a callee-saved register before writing `INDIRECT OK`.
`tests/x86-helper-state42.S` executes `cpuid`, `pcmpistri`, and `pcmpistrm`,
checking their results, x86 flags, RSP, and a callee-saved register before
writing `HELPERS OK`.
`tests/x86-ifunc-like42.S` calls a resolver, invokes the returned function
pointer, and verifies RSP after both returns before writing `IFUNC OK`.
`tests/x86-auxv42.S` validates the Linux x86-64 initial stack, including the
program headers, page size, entry point, platform, random bytes, and executable
name supplied through auxv.
`tests/x86-addr32-call42.S` checks the address-size-prefixed direct call form
used by static glibc and verifies its pushed return address and restored RSP.
`tests/x86-tls42.c` parses `PT_TLS`, copies its initial image into a new static
TLS block, sets FS with `arch_prctl`, and verifies a `__thread` value before
writing `TLS OK`.
`tests/x86-prlimit42.S` queries `RLIMIT_STACK` through x86 `prlimit64` and
checks the returned limit before exiting with 42.
`tests/x86-getrandom42.S` fills 16 bytes through x86 `getrandom`, checks the
result, and exits with 42.
`tests/x86-readlinkat42.S` reads `/proc/self/exe` through x86 `readlinkat`,
checks that an absolute path was returned, and exits with 42.
`tests/x86-mprotect42.S`, `tests/x86-fstat42.S`, and
`tests/x86-exit-group42.S` cover the additional Linux calls used by static
glibc startup and shutdown. The syscall switch and x86 ABI structure
conversions are kept in `native/runtime/x86-linux-user.c`, following the
corresponding cases in `linux-user/syscall.c`.
`tests/x86-entry-regs42.S` checks that the initial guest GPRs are deterministic
and that static ELF `%rdx` is zero, as required for the dynamic-linker finalizer
hook passed to glibc startup.
`tests/x86-argv-env42.S` checks that normal LoongArch command-line arguments
and environment variables appear in the x86 Linux initial stack. Runtime
options beginning with `--latc-` remain reserved for image inspection and
diagnostics.
`tests/x86-long-tb-exit42.S` contains more than 255 straight-line x86
instructions. It verifies that pretranslation continues at LAT's TB length
limit instead of leaving a missing target in the native image.
`tests/x86-static-hello.S` is a static x86-64 ELF with no interpreter and no
host libraries. Its `_start` writes `Hello, LATC!` with the x86 Linux `write`
syscall and exits with the x86 Linux `exit` syscall. This is the first direct
static-translation test. `tests/x86-glibc-hello.c` is the separate full static
glibc fixture used after the smaller call, helper, IFUNC, and auxv tests pass.
It validates `argc`, `argv`, and `getenv`, then prints `Hello from glibc!` and
exits successfully on the 3A6000 test host. The generated LoongArch shell
currently links the small host runtime dynamically; producing a fully static
LoongArch ELF remains separate work.

The AOT output is a static LoongArch PIE containing the copied LAT runner, the
x86-64 guest, its control-flow graph, and LAT AOT code. Paths not present in the
AOT image use LAT's JIT translator unless strict verification is enabled.

Build and test with:

```sh
make -C tools/latc
make -C tools/latc test
tools/latc/build/latc analyze --json /path/to/static-x86_64-elf
tools/latc/build/latc compile /path/to/static-x86_64-elf \
  -o program.la64 --runner /path/to/loongarch64/latc-runner
```

On a LoongArch build host, generate and embed relocatable LAT AOT code with:

```sh
tools/latc/scripts/compile-aot.sh tools/latc/build/latc \
  /path/to/static/latc-runner x86-program program.la64
```

Set `LATC_STRICT_AOT=1` when testing the output. The runner exits with status
125 before decoding if the runtime translator is entered after embedded AOT
loading.

For dependency-coverage acceptance, use `LATC_STRICT_FILE_AOT=1`. It rejects
JIT generation for code backed by an ELF file while allowing non-file mappings
such as the vDSO. `LATC_STRICT_AOT=1` remains the stronger diagnostic mode that
rejects every runtime translation attempt.

Embedded AOT is installed into `$HOME/.cache/latx` on first use. Later runs
reuse it only when a read-only cache file and its latc marker still match the
recorded SHA-256 digest, inode, size, and modification time. Runtime statistics
include `aot_cache_hit`, `bundle_verify_ns`, `guest_extract_ns`, and
`aot_prepare_ns` so startup costs can be separated from guest execution.
`runtime_tb_gen_attempts` is counted at translator entry; strict mode rejects
the attempt before decoding or generating host code.

An optional binary TB key set selects the translated blocks that belong in the
output. Its fixed header contains `LATTBKS`, the format version, source
SHA-256, record count, and sequence. Each fixed-size record contains an
ELF-relative virtual address and semantic translation flags. It deliberately
contains no execution count. Pass it with
`--tbset FILE`. TB-set compilation decodes and translates the ELF control-flow
graph once. The observed `(RVA, flags)` entries add dynamic targets and
translation variants that static decoding cannot derive. This includes CFG
paths that were not executed during collection, x86-64 lazy PLT binding
entries, and validated fixed-stride code-table targets. It avoids repeated
whole-program translation rounds. A wrong source
digest, an address outside executable sections, an unsupported flag, or a
malformed header or record fails compilation. There is no text profile format
or compatibility parser.

The native translation stage partitions the final TB set at page/TU boundaries
and translates the partitions concurrently. `LATC_AOT_THREADS=N` selects 1 to
32 translation threads; when unset, direct compilation uses up to 8 online
CPUs. `latcd` runs up to 8 ELF compile jobs concurrently by default and divides
the online CPUs among those jobs, so module-level and within-module parallelism
share one CPU budget. Explicit thread counts are honored, including 1 and 2.

The module tables are emitted as binary data and included directly by the
assembler. They are not formatted as a large C source file for the host C
compiler to parse. `latcd` accepts a cached module as a TB-set hit only when
every requested `(RVA, flags)` pair exists in that module.

For each source ELF, the version 2 `current` manifest names exactly one `.so`,
one canonical `.native` image, and one complete `.tbset`. The first publication
translates the complete set. A later publication translates only newly added
keys, merges that native image into the canonical image, and links one
replacement `.so`. It does not keep a list of incremental modules. The three
immutable generation files are synchronized before an atomic manifest rename;
only after that commit does `latcd` remove the superseded generation. A failed
compile, merge, link, or pre-manifest publication leaves the prior manifest and
all files it names unchanged. This manifest has no older-format parser.

On LoongArch, validate a copied LAT runner and real x86 guest with:

```sh
make -C tools/latc test-native \
  RUNNER=/path/to/latc-runner X86_GUEST=/path/to/static-x86_64-elf
```

Build a statically linked runner from the matching full LAT checkout on a
LoongArch machine:

```sh
tools/latc/scripts/build-runner.sh /path/to/full/lat /path/to/build-latc-runner
```

The script treats `/path/to/full/lat` as read-only. It creates a disposable
`/path/to/build-latc-runner.source` staging tree and applies the local adapter
there. Delete both build directories after copying out `latx-x86_64`.

`aot-v2-source-map.json` records every canonical AOT v2 integration source and
its generated copy. It covers the main LAT to `tools/latc/lat` copies, the
`tools/latc/aot-v2` runtime files copied into the main runner tree, and the
shared native headers. Generated files marked in `lat-local.json` keep the
minimal imported LAT tree complete; do not edit any mapped target directly.
Regenerate and verify all mapped targets with:

```sh
make -C tools/latc sync-aot-v2-sources
make -C tools/latc check-import
```

`prepare-runner-source.py` reads the same source map and copies its canonical
files into a staging runner. Files in `lat-local.json` without `generated=true`
exist only in the minimal imported tree and remain directly maintained there.
`check-import` prints both the generated path and its canonical source when
they differ.

## Main build and installation

On a LoongArch host, the main Meson build installs one matching AOT v2
toolchain. Configure an explicit prefix, build, and install it as one unit:

```sh
mkdir build-aot-v2 && cd build-aot-v2
../configure --target-list=x86_64-linux-user --enable-latx \
  --optimize-O1 --disable-docs --prefix=/path/to/prefix
ninja
meson install
```

The prefix contains `bin/latx-x86_64`, `bin/latc`, `bin/latcd`,
`lib/liblat-aot-runtime.so.2`, and the compiler helper files below
`libexec/latc`. All four programs and libraries embed the same deterministic
64-character build identity. `latcd` checks the compiler, runner, runtime ABI,
and runtime identity before creating a socket, writing cache files, or running
a compile job. A mismatch is reported and the application can continue with
its normal JIT fallback.

Run the installation-tree integration test with an x86 rootfs and a dynamic
x86 guest. The test does not use binaries or helper scripts from the build
directory:

```sh
make -C tools/latc test-aot-v2-install \
  INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/prefix \
  X86_ROOTFS=/path/to/x86-rootfs \
  X86_GUEST=/path/to/x86-rootfs/usr/bin/echo
```

Each `latcd --serve` or `latcd --once` process takes a non-blocking exclusive
lock on `<cache>/.latcd.lock` before it creates a socket, temporary file,
module, profile, or `current` index. A second process using the same cache exits
with `cache is already owned by another latcd`; use a separate cache directory
if both daemons must run. The lock descriptor remains open for the daemon's
whole lifetime. The kernel releases it after either a normal exit or a crash,
so the text left in `.latcd.lock` is diagnostic information, not a PID-file
liveness check. Service statistics include `cache_owner_pid`.

Analyze all twelve SPECint2000 integer executables with:

```sh
make -C tools/latc test-spec-analyze \
  SPECINT_BINDIR=/path/to/specbin/x64_gcc12_2_0
```

Current limitation: generated LoongArch instructions are regenerated when the
output starts unless the bundle was produced by `compile-aot.sh`. An AOT bundle
stores LAT's LoongArch code and relocation records and loads them before guest
execution. Unresolved paths use JIT unless `LATC_STRICT_AOT=1` is set.

`LATC_STATS_OUT=/path/stats.json` records both startup pretranslation and
`runtime_tb_gen_attempts` and `runtime_tb_gen_calls`. The attempt count must be
checked before claiming that a test ran without entering the runtime
translator. `LATC_DISABLE_PRETRANSLATE=1` provides a JIT baseline for the same
bundle. `continuation_tbs` counts TBs added when LAT ends a TB before the end of
its containing CFG block, including instruction-limit and internal translator
splits. `edge_target_tbs` counts executable static-edge targets not represented
by a standalone CFG block. Jump-table case targets must be CFG TB leaders; the
runner does not scan past alignment NOPs to compensate for missing targets.

For AOT v2, the runtime does not increment counters while a TB executes. It
records the exact `(RVA, semantic flags)` key once when a file-backed TB is
created. A background thread submits pending per-source sets every 100 ms;
normal exit and pre-`execve` handling submit any remainder. It never scans the
global JIT TB table. latcd unions keys from all processes; an unchanged set
does not schedule another compile. In `--flush-only` mode it performs no
compilation until `FLUSH_SOURCE` or `FLUSH_ALL`, then compiles each final source
set once. The flush waits until every previously accepted set is published or
an explicit compile error is returned. A successful flush has already merged
and relinked every accepted increment; it never reports success for a pending
fragment.

Profile-module generation is single-pass. The compiler must include every
requested TB and its required direct branch targets in that pass. A missing
static target fails the job and is reported; the driver does not retry with
supplemental TB sets.

All twelve SPECint2000 integer programs pass the official test workloads with
zero main-ELF runtime code generation. Ten pass full strict mode with no JIT at
all. Perlbmk and vortex use two and four guest VDSO/signal-helper TBs
respectively; they pass main-program strict mode with only that explicit system
JIT fallback. See [spec2000/SPEC2000.md](spec2000/SPEC2000.md) for counts and
AOT sizes. The same strict gzip AOT output runs on AOSC Linux and Loongnix Linux
4.19 3A6000 systems.

The official SPECint2000 train workloads are also automated:

```sh
python3 spec2000/prepare-specint-train.py \
  --latc build/latc --runner /path/to/latx-x86_64 \
  --spec-root /path/to/spec2000 --workdir /path/to/train-bundles
python3 spec2000/bench-specint-train.py \
  --runner /path/to/latx-x86_64 --spec-root /path/to/spec2000 \
  --bundle-dir /path/to/train-bundles/bundles \
  --workdir /path/to/train-benchmark --rounds 5
```

All twelve SPECint2000 integer train workloads passed on the AOSC 3A6000 host
on 2026-08-21. Each individual command used a 30-second hard timeout; the
slowest command completed in 16.76 seconds. VPR was checked with the official
numeric tolerances and all other outputs matched byte for byte. Ref inputs have
not been run. A subsequent full run through `myrun1.sh train` regenerated all
twelve ELFs first, then produced twelve official SPEC `.raw` results with
`valid=1`; the slowest whole benchmark was perlbmk at 44.11 seconds under the
60-second per-benchmark limit.

This proves that the main x86 ELF executes from LAT AOT without entering the
runtime translator for the measured workload. It does not yet produce a
standalone LoongArch program without the LAT runtime: the output remains a
static LoongArch runner containing the x86 ELF, CFG, and LAT AOT image.

Current limitations: AOT generation itself must run on a LoongArch build host;
the runner extracts the embedded AOT into `$HOME/.cache/latx` and the x86 guest
into `/tmp`, so both locations must be writable. Guest VDSO and anonymous
signal-helper pages are not yet serialised as AOT segments. Test and train
workloads are validated. Ref profiles still need separate collection because
they may expose additional indirect targets.
